 ## Work-Day-Scheduler
 

   In this project,  an employee with a busy schedule want to add important events to a daily
   planner to manage time effectively.

   


## what to expect :-

- When you open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

- When you scroll down you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.

- When you view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate 
  whether  it is in the past, present, or future.

- When you click into a timeblock you are able to enter an event.

- When tou click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage.

- When you refresh the page, the saved events persist.

- When you want to clear your calendar for the next day, you will find a button at the top of the calender. 
  It will clear the local storage and the text in the time block.
